# Things to do still

1. plot of hamming dist sd. dist. as a function of amount of data used to find the average points
2. temperature hamming distance variation

## Report Layout

1. Literiture review
2. collecting data from the microbit & saving to computer
3. calculating intra-chip hamming distances vs. inter-chip hamming distances to assess PUF viability
4. filtering the useful bits
5. calculating expected bit values and so expected hamming distances
6. creating a fingerprint bitstream for each microbit & comparing test bitstreams to assess chip similarity

1. looking for repeating patterns in the bitsteams: placing bits in 64-bit groups -> banding pattern -> explore this
